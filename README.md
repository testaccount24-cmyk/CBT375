//***FILE 375 is from David Marsden of Perth, Australia, and        *   FILE 375
//*           contains a collection of SAS programs to read and     *   FILE 375
//*           interpret SMF records.  File 374 contains programs    *   FILE 375
//*           to look at IBM-produced SMF records.  File 375 adds   *   FILE 375
//*           some programs to look at vendor-produced SMF records  *   FILE 375
//*           (Huron and ObjectSTAR).                               *   FILE 375
//*                                                                 *   FILE 375
//*      SAS programs to read Huron/ObjectSTAR SMF records.         *   FILE 375
//*                                                                 *   FILE 375
//*      They all assume that SMF records for Huron/ObjectSTAR      *   FILE 375
//*      have been separated out from other SMF into their own      *   FILE 375
//*      dataset.  See SAS program SMFEXTR in the other PDS of      *   FILE 375
//*      SAS programs for way to do this.  Alternatively add a      *   FILE 375
//*      SAS statement to select the appropriate SMF record         *   FILE 375
//*      type after the input is read.                              *   FILE 375
